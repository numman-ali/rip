# Agent Step

Current focus
- Checkpoint hooks + event frames implemented in tool runtime; next is wiring into ripd session execution.
- Keep capability registry/matrix aligned once checkpoints are exposed on active surfaces.

Reorientation (read in order after compaction)
- `AGENTS.md`
- `agent_step.md`
- `docs/00_index.md`
- `docs/00_doc_map.md`
- `docs/01_north_star.md`
- `docs/07_tasks/roadmap.md`
- `docs/03_contracts/openresponses_coverage.md`
- `docs/03_contracts/openresponses_capability_map.md`
- `docs/07_tasks/openresponses_coverage.md`

Active priorities
- Wire tool runtime + workspace checkpoint hooks into ripd session loop (requires dependency approval).
- Update capability registry/matrix if checkpointing is exposed on CLI/server.
- Keep roadmap doc/impl gaps aligned with recent changes.

Next checkpoints
- Move workspace engine task into Now once approved.

# Agent Step

Current focus
- Tool runtime + workspace checkpoint hooks are wired into ripd; align docs/roadmap and capability registry/matrix.
- Lock in the next Phase 1 Now item after doc alignment.

Reorientation (read in order after compaction)
- `AGENTS.md`
- `agent_step.md`
- `docs/00_index.md`
- `docs/00_doc_map.md`
- `docs/01_north_star.md`
- `docs/07_tasks/roadmap.md`
- `docs/03_contracts/openresponses_coverage.md`
- `docs/03_contracts/openresponses_capability_map.md`
- `docs/07_tasks/openresponses_coverage.md`

Active priorities
- Update capability registry/matrix if checkpointing is now exposed on CLI/server.
- Keep roadmap doc/impl gaps aligned with recent changes.
- Select the next Phase 1 Now task after docs are current.

Next checkpoints
- Confirm next Now item once docs/registry are aligned.

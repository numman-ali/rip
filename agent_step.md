# Agent Step

Current focus
- OpenResponses capability inventory and roadmap alignment (spec MDX + schemas -> capability registry/matrix + roadmap).
- Provider-boundary validation stays in place, but prioritize product-capability mapping + surface parity.

Reorientation (read in order after compaction)
- `AGENTS.md`
- `agent_step.md`
- `docs/00_index.md`
- `docs/00_doc_map.md`
- `docs/01_north_star.md`
- `docs/07_tasks/roadmap.md`
- `docs/03_contracts/openresponses_coverage.md`
- `docs/03_contracts/openresponses_capability_map.md`
- `docs/07_tasks/openresponses_coverage.md`

Active priorities
- Group OpenResponses spec + schema elements into capability-level features.
- Map each capability to `docs/03_contracts/capability_registry.md` and `docs/02_architecture/capability_matrix.md`.
- Ensure every OpenResponses feature appears in `docs/07_tasks/roadmap.md` with `[confirm spec]` or `[needs work]`.

Next checkpoints
- Update roadmap/gap notes if any new capability ids imply surface gaps.
- Continue OpenResponses coverage checklist on remaining non-tool schemas or additive patches.

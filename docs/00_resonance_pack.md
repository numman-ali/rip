# Resonance Pack (Rehydration Index)

Purpose
- This file is a fast entry point *inside* `docs/` for rehydration.
- Canonical operator + agent instructions live in `AGENTS.md` (do not duplicate them here).
- If this conflicts with `AGENTS.md` or the roadmap, treat it as a defect: fix drift in the same change.

Canonical references (required reading order)
1) `AGENTS.md` (operator intent + gates + non-negotiables)
2) `agent_state.md` (mutable working log; must stay current)
3) `docs/02_architecture/continuity_os.md` (the operating model)
4) `docs/06_decisions/ADR-0008-continuity-os.md` (decision: provider state is cache)
5) `docs/07_tasks/roadmap.md` (Now/Next/Later execution plan)
